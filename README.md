## Stages

### Stage 1: Wisteria Garden
Move your cursor across wisteria vines to trigger sounds. Each vine plays musical notes based on its position. Reveal the sleeping cat by interacting with the vines.

### Stage 2: Water Lilies
Click the water to generate flowers. Each flower adds a harmonic voice to the music. Drag flowers to make them bigger, use the mouse wheel to spin them faster or slower (changes sequencer intensity and density), and press spacebar to summon butterflies that add reverb. Click flowers to remove them.

### Stage 3: Rhythm Game
Play drums with arrow keys: Up for open hihat, Down for closed hihat, Left for kick, Right for snare. Your playing speed determines the complexity of the background pattern. Maintain your rhythm to reach the highest stage.

### Stage 4: Bird Song
Click sparkles on tree branches to light them up. Each lit sparkle adds musical layers to the bird songs. Light all four sparkles on a branch to complete that bird's melody.

### Stage 5: Wisteria Garden
Return to the wisteria garden where you can form vines by moving your cursor. Create vine patterns for the cat and watch them sway with realistic physics.
